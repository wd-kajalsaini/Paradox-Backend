          <h3 class="ss__h3heading">Methods of processing</h3>
          <p class="ss__para_sm">The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access,
            disclosure,
            modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data. The Data processing is carried out using computers
            and/or
            IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated.
            In
            addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge,
            involved
            with the operation of this Website (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or
            external
            parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies,
            communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these
            parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
          </p>
          <h3 class="ss__h3heading">Legal basis of processing</h3>
          <p class="ss__para_sm">The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:
          </p>
          <ul class="ss_points mb-5">
            <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the
              Owner
              may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without
              having
              to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
              processing of Personal Data is subject to data protection law;
            </li>
            <li>provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
              pre-contractual obligations thereof;
            </li>
            <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;</li>
            <li>processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
              official
              authority vested in the Owner;
            </li>
            <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a third
              party.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="ss__para_sm">In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that
            applies to
            the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
            requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
          </p>
          <h3 class="ss__h3heading">Place</h3>
          <p class="ss__para_sm">The Data is processed at the Owner’s operating offices and in any other places where
            the
            parties involved in the processing are located
          </p>
          <p class="ss__para_sm">Depending on the User’s location, data transfers may involve transferring the User’s
            Data
            to a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data,
            Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data. Users are also
            entitled to
            learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the jurisdition or to any international
            organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and
            about
            the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
            If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document
            or
            inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
          </p>
          <p class="ss__para_sm">If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant
            sections
            of this document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
          </p>
          <h3 class="ss__h3heading">Retention time</h3>
          <p class="ss__para_sm">Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they
            have been collected for.
          </p>
          <p class="ss__para_sm">Therefore:</p>
          <ul class="ss_points mb-5">
            <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the
              User
              shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
            </li>
            <li>The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given consent
              to
              such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain
              Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or
              upon
              order of an authority.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="ss__para_sm">Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right
            to
            access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be
            enforced
            after expiration of the retention period.
